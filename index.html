    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Alex and I am currently a full time at the University of California, Irvine.
      Currently, I'm a second year studying Computer Science and driven by curiosity, I enjoy problem-solving 
      and working with peers. Outside the classroom, I usually spend my time outdoors doing activies such as 
      snowboarding, backpacking, and hiking. Furthmore, I'm always looking for ways to improve my coding skills and 
      creativity. Feel free to reach out to me for any inquiries or questions.</p>
